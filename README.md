Run your GitHub Actions locally with the power of the [GitHub Locally Actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SanjulaGanepola.github-local-actions) Visual Studio Code extension! Say goodbye to the hassle of committing and pushing changes every time you need to test a workflow. This extension lets you quickly and efficiently run your workflows locally, leveraging the [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) CLI tool. Enjoy a seamless experience with an interface designed to feel as familiar as the official [GitHub Actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-github-actions) extension.

* 🚀 **Run Workflows/Jobs**: Run entire workflows or specific jobs locally without leaving your editor.
* ⚡ **Trigger Events**: Trigger standard [GitHub events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows) to run multiple workflows.
* 📖 **View Workflow Run History**: Track and investigate past workflow logs.
* ⚙️ **Manage Workflow Settings**: Define secrets, variables, inputs, runners, payloads, and options for execution.

✨ Documentation site is now live [here](https://sanjulaganepola.github.io/github-local-actions-docs/)!

## Components

The `Components` view is where you can manage the components for using the extension.

* [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) provides the core functionality for running GitHub Actions locally. Whenever a workflow, job, or event is triggered, the extension is essentially building up an act command and executing it as a [VS Code task](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks). 
* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) is required for nektos/act if you plan to run workflows in containers. The containers are configured to mirror GitHub's environment, including matching [environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#default-environment-variables) and [filesystems](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners#file-systems), ensuring a consistent and reliable local execution. 

    > If you do not require container isolation, you can run selected (e.g. Windows or MacOS) workflow jobs directly on your system. In this case, you do not need to have docker installed or running. Click [here](https://sanjulaganepola.github.io/github-local-actions-docs/usage/settings/#runners) to learn how to use your host system as your runner.
